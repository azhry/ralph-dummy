# Wedding Invitation Backend Implementation

## Current Understanding

Based on the docs/backend specification, I need to implement a complete wedding invitation system with:
- Go backend with Gin framework
- MongoDB database
- JWT authentication
- Wedding management with slugs
- Guest management with CSV import
- RSVP system
- File uploads (S3/R2)
- Email notifications
- Analytics and rate limiting
- Production deployment

## Phase 1 Foundation Implementation Plan

I'll start with Phase 1 (Week 1-2) which includes:
1. ✅ Project setup and structure
2. ✅ Configuration management  
3. ✅ MongoDB connection
4. ✅ Domain models and repository interfaces
5. User authentication (register/login)
6. Basic wedding CRUD
7. Docker setup

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure and Dependencies ✅
- Created go.mod with wedding-invitation-backend module
- Set up proper directory structure following clean architecture
- Installed core dependencies: gin, mongo-driver, jwt, bcrypt, validator, viper, zap
- Added comprehensive README with development setup instructions

### 2. Configuration Management System ✅
- Created comprehensive config package with viper integration
- Support environment variables and YAML config files
- Added defaults for all required configuration values
- Include configuration for server, database, auth, storage, and email
- Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Created .env.example template for development

### 3. MongoDB Connection Layer ✅
- Created MongoDB connection manager with proper timeout and error handling
- Implemented database connection with ping verification
- Added collection access method and database reference
- Implemented EnsureIndexes with unique email and slug indexes
- Created comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Added test suites for full MongoDB integration when available
- Include skip logic for short mode without MongoDB

### 4. Domain Models and Repository Interfaces ✅
- **User Model**: Complete user entity with authentication fields, validation tags, and status management
- **Wedding Model**: Comprehensive wedding structure with nested EventDetails, CoupleInfo, ThemeSettings, RSVPSettings, and Gallery
- **RSVP Model**: Full RSVP system with plus-one support, custom questions, dietary restrictions, and metadata tracking
- **Guest Model**: Guest list management with import batch support and invitation tracking
- **Analytics Models**: Event tracking for page views, interactions, and aggregated analytics
- **Repository Interfaces**: Clean architecture with separate interfaces for User, Wedding, RSVP, Guest, and Analytics repositories
- **Helper Methods**: Business logic methods like IsRSVPOpen(), IsAccessible(), CanBeModified()
- **Filter Types**: Comprehensive filter structs for querying with pagination and date ranges
- **Validation Tags**: Complete validation rules matching database schema requirements

## Key Requirements from Specification
- All functions must work correctly
- Unit tests for all components with passing tests
- Push each completed feature to GitHub repo
- Follow the project structure and technology stack defined in the docs

## Current Task: JWT Authentication System

I'm now implementing the JWT authentication system which includes:
1. JWT utilities for token generation and validation
2. Password hashing utilities with bcrypt
3. Authentication service with register/login logic
4. Authentication handlers for HTTP endpoints
5. Authentication middleware for route protection

### Progress
- ✅ Foundation complete (config, database, models)
- 🔄 JWT authentication system (in progress)
- ⏳ User management system (blocked)
- ⏳ Wedding CRUD operations (blocked)
- ⏳ Docker environment setup (blocked)
- ⏳ Unit tests (blocked)

The foundation is now solid with clean architecture, proper configuration, database connectivity, and comprehensive domain models ready for business logic implementation.
