# Wedding Invitation Backend Implementation

## Current Understanding

Based on the docs/backend specification, I need to implement a complete wedding invitation system with:
- Go backend with Gin framework
- MongoDB database
- JWT authentication
- Wedding management with slugs
- Guest management with CSV import
- RSVP system
- File uploads (S3/R2)
- Email notifications
- Analytics and rate limiting
- Production deployment

## Phase 1 Foundation Implementation Plan

I'll start with Phase 1 (Week 1-2) which includes:
1. Project setup and structure
2. Configuration management  
3. MongoDB connection
4. User authentication (register/login)
5. Basic wedding CRUD
6. Docker setup

## Key Requirements from Specification
- All functions must work correctly
- Unit tests for all components with passing tests
- Push each completed feature to GitHub repo
- Follow the project structure and technology stack defined in the docs

## Next Steps
1. Initialize Go project with proper structure
2. Set up configuration management
3. Implement MongoDB connection layer
4. Create domain models and repositories
5. Implement authentication system
6. Add basic wedding CRUD
7. Write comprehensive tests
8. Set up Docker environment

This will establish the foundation for all subsequent phases.
